extended-description = """\
unFTP (unftp) is a FTP(S) server written in Rust and built on top of libunftp and the Tokio asynchronous run-time. It is
unlike your normal FTP server in that it provides:
- Configurable Authentication (e.g. Anonymous, PAM or a JSON file).
- Configurable storage back-ends (e.g. GCS or filesystem)
- An HTTP server with health endpoints for use for example in Kubernetes for readiness and liveness probes.
- Integration with Prometheus for monitoring.
- A proxy protocol mode for use behind proxies like HA Proxy and Nginx.

With unFTP, you can present RFC compliant FTP(S) to the outside world while freeing yourself to use modern APIs and
techniques on the inside of your perimeter.
