When you need to FTP, but don't want to.

[**Website**](https://unftp.rs) | [**Docs**](https://unftp.rs/server) | [**libunftp
**](https://github.com/bolcom/libunftp)

unFTP is an FTP(S) server written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) and built on top
of [libunftp](https://github.com/bolcom/libunftp) and the [Tokio](https://tokio.rs) asynchronous run-time. It is **un**
like your normal FTP server in that it provides:

- Configurable Authentication (e.g. Anonymous, [PAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_PAM), a JSON file or HTTP).
- Configurable storage back-ends (e.g. [GCS](https://cloud.google.com/storage/) or filesystem)
- Configurable notifications (e.g. events over [Google Pub/Sub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/overview))
- An HTTP server with health endpoints for use for example in Kubernetes for readiness and liveness probes.
- Integration with [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io) for monitoring.
- A proxy protocol mode for use behind proxies like HA Proxy and Nginx.
- Structured logging and the ability to ship logs to [Google Cloud Logging](https://cloud.google.com/logging) or a Redis
  instance.

With unFTP, you can present RFC compliant FTP(S) to the outside world while freeing yourself to use modern APIs and
techniques on the inside of your perimeter.

## Installation and Usage

User documentation are available on our website [unftp.rs](https://unftp.rs)

## Provided Docker Images

The project contains templated Dockerfiles . To get a list of available commands to create them, run:

```sh
make help
```

We offer 3 different options for building an unFTP docker image:

- `scratch`: builds the binary in [rust:slim](https://hub.docker.com/_/rust) and deploys in a `FROM scratch` image. The
  unFTP binary is statically linked using [musl libc](https://www.musl-libc.org/).
- `alpine` (default): builds in [rust:slim](https://hub.docker.com/_/rust) and deploy in alpine. This image is built
  with musl instead of a full-blown libc. The unFTP binary is statically linked
  using [musl libc](https://www.musl-libc.org/).
- `alpine-debug`: same images as `alpine` but using the debug build of unftp and adds tools
  like [lftp](https://lftp.yar.ru/) and [CurlFtpFS](http://curlftpfs.sourceforge.net/) while also running as root.

To build the alpine docker image:

```sh
make docker-image-alpine
```

Alternatively you can download pre-made images from [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/bolcom/unftp/tags).

## Enabling tokio-console

You can use [tokio-console](https://github.com/tokio-rs/console) to analyze async tasks running in unFTP. To do this you
need to compile a build or run with the `tokio_console` feature enabled while also enabling the `tokio_unstable cfg`.

For example:

```sh
RUSTFLAGS="--cfg tokio_unstable" cargo build --features tokio_console
```

or:

```shell
RUSTFLAGS="--cfg tokio_unstable" cargo run --features tokio_console -- -vv --auth-type=anonymous
```

unFTP will listen on default port 6669 for connections from tokio-console.

## Selective compiling

The unFTP `Cargo.toml` file lists features that allows enabling or disabling storage and authentication back-ends.

These are the default ones: "auth_rest", "sbe_gcs", "auth_jsonfile", "sbe_opendal".

The binary called `unftp_x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` that we provide via the unFTP GitHub releases also enables
`auth_pam`.
